## Context for the challenge (copied from https://community.storytellingwithdata.com/challenges/aug-2025-avoid-the-spaghetti-graph)

Line graphs are generally a great way to show data over time. However, when there are too many series in a single chart, it can quickly become what I refer to as a “spaghetti graph”—a tangled mess of overlapping lines that’s hard to read.

This month’s example comes from the soon-to-be-released 10th anniversary edition of storytelling with data, where I refreshed visuals and examples throughout the book (including this one!) and added special new bonus content.

How would you redesign the following visual to avoid the spaghetti graph? That’s your challenge!
